# Hangman-game-Adam-asmaca-oyunu-

This project is a simple hangman game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is a web application that runs in the browser and allows the user to test their word-guessing abilities.

## How It Works

The game runs in the browser, presenting the user with the task of guessing a specific word. The user attempts to guess the entire word by entering letters. With each incorrect guess, a hanging figure is progressively drawn. The game continues until a certain number of incorrect guesses are made.

## Project Files

- **index.html:** The main HTML file of the game.
- **style.css:** The CSS file containing the styling and design of the game.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that controls the functionality of the game.
